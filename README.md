# Symbolic-Regression-with-GP-on-Custom-Symbolic-Form

In Symbolic Regression, the idea is to create mathematical expressions that accurately model
the relationship between the input and the output variables provided in a training dataset.
In other words, the symbolic regression process finds a mathematical expression that best
fits with the provided dataset. In genetic programming, SR ( Symbolic Regression ) is
to find a perfect fit of the data points provided in a dataset and search for a function
from a possible search space of s-expression ( Symbolic expression ) that fits the given
data points, which is derived from a set of predefined functions and terminals. Furthermore, symbolic regression aims to find the expression that best fits the points and aims
to find a perfect or closest match between the predicted and the actual output values.
